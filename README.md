# Object-Detection-and-Navigation-System-for-Accessibility
A real-time accessibility tool that uses BLIP for image captioning, OpenCV for camera capture, and gTTS for speech synthesis. The system periodically describes surroundings through voice, helping visually impaired users navigate safely via automated captions and audio output.
